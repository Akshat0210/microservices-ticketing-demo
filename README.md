Katacoda Microservices / Distributed Systems Example - Ticketing Service
========================================================================

The idea behind this example is to demonstrate certain distributed systems concepts. It has been created as part of Katacoda training.

The application is loosely based on users purchasing events for a event. The application demonstrates the following concepts:
  * Service Discovery using Hashicorp Consul
  * Version Aware Routing
  * Retry Pattern against fragile systems
  * Rate Limiting, UPS and Circuit Breaking to limit data loss and downtime
  * Async messaging using Queues for stability and scalability
  * Web Tokens for Service Security
  * TLS and Key Rotation for Service Security
  * OpenTracing, Zipkin, Correlation IDs for logging and Prometheus for monitoring and observability

This is designed to demonstrate concepts, not a copy/paste production implementation.
